# PubgArchiver
Hello and welcome to my project!

(If you are here it is probably because you are looking for something else)

PubgArchiver is slated to be a simple Python api to grab a player's recent PUBG match history and store the their player stats from each individual match into Google Sheets. This project is intended to automate the process of storing a player's PUBG match history (pubg likes to reset match history, and stat tracking websites don't give you all the information or in a format I find useful)

I have and will continue to do everything in my power to keep this project simple and concise.
