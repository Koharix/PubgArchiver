# PubgArchiver
Hello and welcome to the PubgArchiver, developed by Koharix Logic!

(If you are here it is probably because you are looking for something else)

PubgArchiver is slated to be a simple Python api that grabs a player's recent PUBG match history and stores their stats from each individual match into Google Sheets. 

This project is intended to automate the process of storing a player's PUBG match history (pubg often resets match history & stat tracking websites lack information)

I have and will continue to do everything in my power to keep the project simple and concise.
