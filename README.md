# PubgArchiver
Hello and welcome to my project. If you are here it is probably because you are looking for something else, anyway!

PubgArchiver is slated to be a simple Python api script to grab a player's recent PUBG match history and store the stats of a given player for every match within recent match history and store that information into Google Sheets. This project is intended to automate the process of storing a player's PUBG match history storage (pubg likes to reset match history, and stat tracking pubg websites don't give you all the information or in a format I like)

I have and will continue to do everything in my power to keep this project simple and concise.
